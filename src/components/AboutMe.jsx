                Hello, I'm Mari, a front-end web developer dedicated to merging analytical thinking with artistic creativity. My professional journey began in finance, where I honed my analytical skills and financial expertise. Additionally, I underwent 12 years of formal fine arts education, fostering a creative mindset that allows me to see innovative solutions in every challenge. This unique blend finds its true expression in my passion for front-end development. I am inspired by a deep appreciation for the transformative impact of technology on our world.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond the screen, I'm an avid skier, scuba diver, and runner â€” a challenge seeker at heart. These pursuits have ingrained in me a resilience and determination that I bring to every project. I believe that the pursuit of excellence is a journey, and I'm eager to embark on it as a key player in the dynamic realm of software engineering.
